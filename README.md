Assignment 37-01
You already have a functioning way of fetching data from a Products table and showing
it on a web page.
Now we want to create a rudimentary shop that, for the moment, has only one merchant
and only one buyer.
The merchant accesses the website using the /merchant endpoint, which allows them to
input the details of a Product. Assume that every product has an image that is a URL of
an already existing image on the internet. Create the UI and the logic for taking the
details of the product, and save these details in the database.
The buyer accesses the website using the /shop endpoint, which allows them to view all
the Products in the shop in a grid. You already wrote the code to get the Products in a list,
now create the UI and the logic for displaying limited details of the product in a clickable
grid which on clicking displays more details for that particular product.
For your next assignment, youâ€™re going to need a Cart database table. Start thinking about
how it should be designed.
